# Real Time Bus Tracker

Description: Using real-time data from MBTA, this project keeps track of the movement of route 1 bus (between Nubian Station & Harvard Square). Bus location is updated every 15 seconds.

How to Run: Download files to local device. For file realtimebustracker.js, line 1, fill in your own access token for mapboxgl. Run index.html file on any browser.

Roadmap of future improvements: Mark the bus route in a different color, and mark all bus stops on the route would make the map more readable. Currently this project only shows one bus, can update to show all buses in transit.
